# PsychoPy_collocations

The idea behind this short task is that participants will hear figurative expressions in Spanish and they will have to choose with a mouse-click the equivalent expression in English from the list available for them on the screen. In total it is 8 expressions in Spanish, but the possible answers in English are 12, so the solution is not as straightforward.
